## 🚀 About Me

I'm a graduating senior at **Drake University** (Class of 2026) pursuing dual B.S. degrees in **Computer Science** and **Artificial Intelligence** with minors in **Cybersecurity** and **Information Systems**. Starting June 2026, I'll be joining **UL Solutions** as a full-time **AI Incubator Engineer**.

My interests span across AI/ML systems, cybersecurity, and infrastructure automation. When I'm not coding, you'll find me competing in cyber competitions, optimizing my homelab, or experimenting with local AI.
